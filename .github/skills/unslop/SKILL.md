# Unslop

Edit text to remove AI patterns and add human voice.

1. Scan for the patterns below.
2. Rewrite. Preserve meaning and match the intended tone.
3. Add soul.
4. Self-audit: "What makes this obviously AI generated?" Fix the remaining tells.

Removing patterns is half the job. Sterile, voiceless writing is just as obvious.

- Have opinions. React to facts instead of neutrally listing pros and cons.
- Vary rhythm. Short sentences. Then longer ones that take their time. Mix it up.
- Acknowledge complexity. "Impressive but also kind of unsettling" beats "impressive."
- Use "I" when it fits. First person is not unprofessional.
- Let some mess in. Perfect structure feels algorithmic.
- Be specific. Not "this is concerning" but "there's something unsettling about agents churning away at 3am."

## Patterns to detect and fix

1. **Significance inflation.** "pivotal moment", "testament to", "evolving landscape", "setting the stage for", "indelible mark", "deeply rooted". Cut puffery, state what happened.
2. **Notability name-dropping.** Listing media outlets without context. Pick one, say what was said.
3. **Superficial -ing phrases.** "highlighting...", "ensuring...", "reflecting...", "showcasing...", "fostering...". Delete or expand with real sources.
4. **Promotional language.** "nestled", "vibrant", "breathtaking", "groundbreaking", "renowned", "stunning", "must-visit". Use neutral descriptions.
5. **Vague attributions.** "Experts believe", "Industry reports suggest", "Some critics argue". Name the source or delete.
6. **Formulaic challenges.** "Despite challenges... continues to thrive." Replace with specific facts.
7. **AI vocabulary.** Additionally, crucial, delve, enduring, enhance, fostering, garner, interplay, intricate, landscape as an abstract noun, pivotal, showcase, tapestry as an abstract noun, testament, underscore, vibrant. Replace with plain words.
8. **Copula avoidance.** "serves as", "stands as", "boasts", "features". Just say "is" or "has".
9. **Negative parallelisms.** "It's not just X, it's Y." State the point directly.
10. **Rule of three.** Forcing ideas into groups of three. Use the natural number.
11. **Synonym cycling.** Protagonist, main character, central figure, hero all in one paragraph. Pick one, repeat it.
12. **False ranges.** "from X to Y" where X and Y are not on a meaningful scale. List topics directly.
13. **Em dash overuse.** Avoid em dashes entirely. Use periods or commas only. Do not swap in parentheses, en dashes, or hyphen-as-dash substitutes. If a thought needs separation, end the sentence or use a comma.
14. **Colon overuse.** Colons are fine before a list or example. Do not use them as mid-sentence connectors. "If you're coming from traditional automation: instead of registering event handlers, you describe conditions" adds nothing with the colon. Rewrite so the point stands without comparison framing. "Describing when the scheduler should fire works best as plain English."
15. **Boldface overuse.** Do not bold every proper noun or acronym.
16. **Inline-header lists.** The tell is a bold label and colon that restates the line: "**Performance:** Performance improved...". Convert those to prose. A bold lead-in that ends in a period, names the item, and is followed by genuinely new detail is fine.
17. **Title case headings.** Use sentence case.
18. **Decorative emojis.** Remove from headings and bullets.
19. **Curly quotes.** Replace with straight quotes.
20. **Chatbot phrases.** "I hope this helps!", "Let me know if...", "Of course!", "Certainly!", "Found the smoking gun!" Remove.
21. **Cutoff disclaimers.** "While specific details are limited..." Find sources or remove.
22. **Sycophantic tone.** "Great question! You're absolutely right!" Respond directly.
23. **Filler phrases.** "In order to" becomes "To". "Due to the fact that" becomes "Because". "It is important to note that" gets deleted.
24. **Excessive hedging.** "could potentially possibly be argued that it might" becomes "may".
25. **Generic conclusions.** "The future looks bright." State specific plans or facts.
26. **Abstract metaphor nouns.** Substrate, wedge, vector, locus, vantage, nexus, primitive as a noun, harness as metaphor, surface as in "API surface", bedrock, scaffolding as metaphor, modality, paradigm, gold-plating. These read as technical but usually have a plainer concrete word. "Substrate" becomes "base". "Wedge in" becomes "add". "Vector" becomes "way" or "method". "Gold-plating" becomes "more than the job needs". Pick the concrete word.
27. **Say the concrete thing.** Do not wrap a simple point in abstract framing, and do not describe how something feels instead of what it does. "the database stays close at hand", "SQL you can read", "types that follow your schema" name a feeling. The fix names the mechanism or a number: "`.toSQL()` returns the exact string sent to the database", "a column rename fails the build". Ask what the sentence tells the reader to do or know, then write that. If you cannot restate it as a concrete instruction, fact, or number, cut it.
28. **Shorten or split dense sentences.** If the reader has to backtrack to parse a sentence, break it in two or drop clauses. One idea per sentence.
29. **Active voice.** Prefer it. Catch "is/are/was/were + past participle" and name the actor: "queries are validated" becomes "the compiler validates queries", "the file is parsed by the loader" becomes "the loader parses the file". Passive is fine only when the actor is unknown or genuinely does not matter.
30. **Cut adverbs, or use a stronger verb.** "runs quickly" becomes "is fast" or the number. "significantly improves" becomes the measured delta. An adverb propping up a weak verb means the verb is wrong.
31. **Prefer the plain word.** "utilize" becomes "use", "leverage" becomes "use", "facilitate" becomes "help", "numerous" becomes "many", "in the event that" becomes "if". The fancier synonym is rarely clearer.
